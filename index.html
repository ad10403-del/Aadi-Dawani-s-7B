    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Video games are neither completely <em>good</em> nor <em>bad</em>. When played in moderation, they can improve focus, memory,
        problem-solving skills, and reaction time. Choosing the right types of games and balancing play with school,
        physical activity, and social interactions is key to keeping gaming positive.
    </p>
    <p>
        Excessive play, however, may lead to sleep issues, social difficulties, or eye strain. Like many activities, 
        <em>responsible gaming</em> allows players to enjoy benefits while avoiding drawbacks.
