    <ul><li><b>Improved attention and focus</b>, Playing action based video games in particular, can train the brain to better focus on relevant information and ignore distractions.</li>
<li><b>Faster information processing</b>, Video games can improve the speed of 
information processing by demanding players to constantly <i>interpret novel data,</i>
adapt strategies, and make decisions in dynamic, interactive environments.</li>
<li><b>Improved hand-eye cooridinations and reaction times</b>, The need for quick, precise movements in many games hones motor skills, reflexes and brain structures.
    <h2>Negatives of video games</h2>
    <ul><li><b>Addiction</b>, Video game addiction (<i>formally recognized as "gaming disorder" by the World Health Organization)</i> 
        is fueled  by specific game design mechanics that exploit psychological principles, primarily the brain's reward system. 
        These mechanics are intentionally integrated to maximize player engagement and retention, which can, in susceptible individuals, lead to addictive behaviors.</li> 
        <li><b>Poor Sleep And Brain Fog</b>, by specific game design mechanics that exploit psychological principles, primarily the <i>brain's reward system.</i>
            These mechanics are intentionally integrated to maximize player engagement and retention, which can, in susceptible individuals, lead to addictive behaviors.</li> 
            <li><b>Social skill decline</b>, Excessive video game play can contribute to social skills decline through a combination of reduced <i>real-world interaction time,</i>
                altered brain function in areas governing social and emotional processing, and the potential development of addictive behaviors. 

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                <p>Video games are not simply <i>good or bad</i> for the brain. They can improve skills such as problem-solving, reaction time, memory and creativity, especially <br>
                when players choose the right types of games and play in moderation. However, excessive gaming can negatively affect sleep, concentration, mental health and social life.<br>

                    The effect video games have on the brain depends on factors such as how long a person plays, what type of games they play, and how well gaming is balanced with school, <br>
                    physical activity, and real-life interactions. <i>When used responsibly</i>, video games can be a positive and enjoyable part of life rather than a harmful habit.
